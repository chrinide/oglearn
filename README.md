oglearn
=======

ogrisel's utility extensions for [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org)

This library is experimental:

- the API will break,
- stuff might go away without notice,
- the documentation is lacking or inexistant,
- test coverage will be very low or inexistant,
- I don't intend to do any release.

I plan to rework this codebase a lot and dump ad-hoc code here. Hence tests,
doc and consistent API are not (yet) the focus.

The license is MIT.

Useful stuff from this lib might hand up upstream in scikit-learn at some point
or never.

Currently features:

- dataset visualization utilities:
  - PCA + scatter plot
  - gallery of pictures

- bootstrapped scores

- plotting learning curves
