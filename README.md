oglearn
=======

ogrisel's utility extensions for [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org)

This library is experimental: the API will break and I don't intend to do any
release. The license is MIT.

Useful stuff from this lib might hand up upstream in scikit-learn at some point
or never.

Currently features:

- dataset visualization utilities:
  - PCA + scatter plot
  - gallery of pictures

- bootstrapped scores

- plotting learning curves
